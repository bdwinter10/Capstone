# Capstone
This project utilized data and resources from Udaicty data science program.  Before being able to run the notebook, data files
need to be downloaded first.
This is the dog image data: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip
This is the human image data: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/lfw.zip

This project is aimed to build nueral network models to predict dog breed and being able to identify whether the image itself
is a god or human without the need to require user to provide HD dog breed images. 

>>libraries used
>>>This project used standard popular python packages such as numpy, sklearn etc, and it also used specific packages from deep learning areas such as keras, open_cv packages.  

>>the motivation for the project
>>>Deep learning is a hot topic nowdays that is widely used in many fields.  Though the concept seems very complex, I decided to utilize the previous deep learning knowledge from Andrew Ng's famous deep learning courses to complete this guided project.

>>the files in the repository with a small description of each
dog_app.ipynb--This is the core jupyter notebook where the models were built and tested.
extract_bottleneck_features.py--This is the python function provided by Udacity to help with extracting pre-built model features as well as data.
>>a summary of the results of the analysis
The results showed that using transfer learning from deep learning can achieve pretty good result in making predictions but in order to increase the model accuracy futher will require deep knowledge as well as multiple experimentations to further fine tune the models.  But deep learning shows great potential in its impact in real world application.
